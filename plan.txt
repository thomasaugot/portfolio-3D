You are a professional creative web designer and developer specialized in Next.js 15, TypeScript, TailwindCSS (with my custom theme), GSAP, and Three.js.
I want you to design and build a cinematic portfolio landing page that works for both:

Hiring managers / companies (who want to evaluate me as a fullstack developer for a job)

Potential freelance clients (who want to hire me for projects).

⚡ The page must feel professional, artistic, and futuristic, with high-impact animations and a clear flow.
⚡ The design should balance credibility for companies with wow factor for clients.
⚡ The animations should feel like a continuous timeline, not random triggers.

🔑 General Rules

Use Next.js 15 App Router + TypeScript.

Use TailwindCSS with my provided theme variables and fonts:

--font-inter: "Inter", sans-serif;
--font-mono: "JetBrains Mono", monospace;
--font-fun: "Audiowide", sans-serif;

--primary-color: #ccff02;
--secondary-color: #02bccc;

--color-bg: var(--color-bg);
--color-text: var(--color-text);
--color-text-muted: var(--color-text-muted);
--color-surface: var(--color-surface);
--color-border: var(--color-border);


Gradients must use my predefined classes: .gradient-primary, .gradient-primary-hover, .gradient-primary-reverse.

Animations can use my custom keyframes: orbit, particleFloat, pulseGlow.

Typography:

Headings → font-fun

Body → font-inter

Code/Labels → font-mono

Animations must use GSAP + ScrollTrigger.

Interactive 3D must use Three.js with React cleanup.

Everything must be mobile-first responsive.

🎬 Section-by-Section Flow
1. Hero Section (Already Built)

✅ Keep my 3D hex grid, models, scroll transition.
Do NOT replace it. Work with it as the cinematic intro.

2. Skills Section

🎯 Show skills clearly, but dynamic.

Glassmorphic cards: Tailwind backdrop-blur-lg bg-surface/70 border border-border rounded-2xl.

Floating Three.js icons (React, GSAP, Docker, Node) orbit subtly in background using orbit keyframes.

Hover: card lifts (translate-y-[-6px] scale-105) + glowing border (shadow-[0_0_20px_var(--primary-color)]).

3. Projects Section

🎯 Cinematic showcase.

Each project = full-screen scroll panel.

ScrollTrigger animation:

Project image/video (placeholder = https://placehold.co/800x500) slides from left.

Text fades/slides from right.

Background hue shifts (use .gradient-primary-reverse overlays).

Optional: use Three.js device mockup with screenshot texture (laptop, phone).

Scroll = mockup slowly rotates (gsap.to(rotation.y, …)).

4. Highlights Section

🎯 Quick proof of experience.

Animated counters (0 → 20+ projects, 0 → 5+ years).

SVG path line animation → connects highlight cards like a timeline.

Cards: Tailwind glass style (bg-surface/60 border border-border shadow-xl).

Animate sequential entry with GSAP stagger.

5. Process Section

🎯 Show workflow clarity.

Horizontal pinned scroll (3 steps: Discover → Build → Launch).

Each step fills screen as user scrolls horizontally.

Add small 3D icons (lightbulb, gears, rocket) floating in background.

Rocket leaves a particle trail using particleFloat keyframe.

6. About Me Section

🎯 Human side.

Background: Three.js globe with glowing connection arcs.

Text: glitch typewriter effect (font-mono uppercase text-muted).

Photos: Polaroid-style images stagger in with GSAP rotation.

Small flags bounce with hover micro-interaction (scale-110 animate-bounce).

7. Contact / CTA Section

🎯 Final punch.

Floating glass contact card (bg-surface/50 backdrop-blur-xl border border-border).

Background: Three.js particle field.

CTA Button:

Magnetic hover effect (scale-105 rotate-1).

pulseGlow animation on hover border.

Ripple effect on click (gsap radialGradient expand).

🔄 Section Transitions (Cinematic Flow)

Hero → Skills: hex grid collapses into divider → Skills fade in.

Skills → Projects: diagonal gradient wipe + blur out skills.

Projects → Highlights: background brightens, counters slide up.

Highlights → Process: timeline line extends seamlessly into Process scroll.

Process → About: rocket launch triggers globe spin.

About → Contact: photo grid collapses → floating contact card emerges.

🛠️ Technical Deliverables

Full page.tsx with sections in order.

Individual React components with Tailwind classes applied.

GSAP timelines in custom hooks (useGSAPAnimations).

Three.js integrated with proper cleanup in React.

Placeholders for images/videos (https://placehold.co/ or https://picsum.photos/).

Animations must follow my color palette and theme variables exactly.

Task: Build a professional, cinematic developer portfolio for Thomas Augot using Next.js 15 + Tailwind CSS + GSAP.
The Hero and Skills sections remain exactly as implemented (your Three.js hero + GSAP scroll transition and your Skills grid).
This prompt defines everything after Skills.

🏗️ Section Order (After Skills)
3. Projects (Portfolio Showcase)

Layout: full-viewport sections (scroll-snapped). Each project takes 100vh.

Projects:

Dos × Dos Internal App — CRM redesign, added usability & features.

Energía Solar Canarias — real-time dashboards, multiple API integrations.

Galaga Agency Website — animated, SEO-optimized agency site.

Osly Solutions App — React Native building access app, App Store + Play Store.

Visuals:

Each project = image mockup or short demo video background.

Title + tagline overlay.

Animations (GSAP):

Parallax: background image moves slower than overlay text.

Split text reveal for titles (letters slide upward).

Mockup hover = subtle 3D CSS tilt.

Transition: last project dissolves → morphs into stats.

4. Highlights (Stats / Quick Credibility)

Content:

20+ Projects Delivered

3+ Years Experience

Worked in 4 Countries

Trilingual: FR | EN | ES

Layout: 2×2 grid of stat cards.

Animations:

GSAP number tween (0 → final).

Cards fade + scale in stagger.

On complete, brief glow pulse.

Transition: counters shrink and fold into a horizontal line → becomes Process diagram.

5. Process (Your Workflow)

Steps: Discover → Build → Launch.

Layout: horizontal 3-step timeline.

Icons: lightbulb, gears, rocket.

Animations:

GSAP line-drawing effect traces the timeline.

Icons pop in sequentially.

Rocket wiggles at the end.

Transition: rocket launches upward → screen fade reveals About.

6. About Me (Personal Story)

Layout: split-screen.

Left: photo of you (or placeholder, later replaceable).

Right: text blocks.

Text (shortened + web-ready):

“Career-changer from hospitality → tech. Now coding by the ocean in Gran Canaria.”

“Frontend specialist with React, Next.js, GSAP. Curious, adventurous, creative.”

“Certified: React Native Developer, CSS, HTML, Version Control.”

Extras: certifications displayed as badge icons under text.

Animations:

Typewriter effect for the intro line.

Photo slow zoom.

Badges fade in staggered.

Transition: fade out into Contact.

7. Contact (Final CTA)

Layout: centered glassmorphic card with backdrop blur.

Content:

Email: thomas.augot@hotmail.fr

LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/thomas-augot

Location: Las Palmas, Spain

CTA Button: “Let’s Build Together”

Animations:

Card fade + rise from bottom.

CTA button has pulseGlow loop animation.

Background has a subtle animated gradient shift.

⚡ Technical Rules

Hero + Skills → keep as-is (your existing Three.js + GSAP + Tailwind implementation).

Everything after = new sections defined above.

Animations: GSAP only (no more Three.js after Hero).

Layout: responsive, mobile-first with Tailwind.

Code: modular (/components, /sections, /hooks/animations).

Content: use real portfolio details (no filler text).

👉 That’s now the precise prompt:

Hero + Skills untouched.

Projects → Highlights → Process → About → Contact fully defined with exact animations + content.

Professional, cinematic, not gimmicky.
