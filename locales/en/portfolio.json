      "challenge": "Dos por Dos needed a digital presence aligned with their high-end commercial design work. Their previous site was static, lacked portfolio structure, had no SEO strategy, and provided no way to manage content independently.",
      "solution": "I built a complete web platform with two components: a public-facing animated website showcasing services, portfolio, and blog; and a private admin panel enabling the team to publish and manage content without developer dependency.",
      "technical_approach": "Built with Next.js 15 (App Router) for optimal SEO and performance.

The company lacked a proprietary tool to centralize data, manage users and plants, control pricing, or calculate revenue. Mobile access was fragmented through non-optimized web versions or third-party apps.",
      "solution": "I developed a modular web application with role-based access. Clients get unified access to all their plants with clear visualization of production, consumption, battery charge, savings, and alerts. Administrators get a complete CRM to manage users, assign plants, review installations, and modify contracts. All data from different providers displays in a visually consistent, unified format.",

      "solution": "I built both the frontend and backend from scratch — a robust, modular system with differentiated user roles and full audit capability. The interface is intuitive, while the backend enforces strict access policies and traceability for every action. The project was developed end-to-end under Galaga Agency’s ownership.",
      "technical_approach": "The frontend was built with React 18, TypeScript, and Vite, using Tailwind CSS for a clean, consistent design system. Animations were implemented with GSAP to enhance UX.
